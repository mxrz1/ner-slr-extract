Other categories capture information about  Architecture, Models, Appraoches in detail, Knowledge Bases/Graphs, Evaluation approach, Datasets used, Strengths/Limitations/Objectives of the papers and NER features. Do not add information about these things, except they are really extravagant. An example (but not limited to) could be that they share an insight about how a specific part of their approach is per design good for NER or perform beter with this part/tool/model/architecture. Another example would be that they explain why they say longer context windows are not necessary."
