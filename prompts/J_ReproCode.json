If **none** are evidenced, set **Answer = `Not reported`** and list **no items**.\n- **Inference policy:** If a named **library implies a language** (e.g., Apache OpenNLP ⇒ Java) but the language is **not explicitly stated**, include the **library** in **Answer** and add the language only as a **`[Background note]`** in *Explanation & key points* (and elaborate in *Long explanation*). **Do not** present inferred items as evidence.\n- **Exclusions:** Omit minor utilities (plotting/logging) unless authors claim they are core to NER. Include **versions** only if stated.\n- **Not selected / prototypes (if any):**  List alternative stacks tested but not used for final results, each with an evidence quote.."
