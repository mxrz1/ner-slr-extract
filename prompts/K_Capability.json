Report **base types** only.\n- **Per-dataset separation:** If multiple datasets are used, **list entity types per dataset separately**; **do not merge** sets.\n- **Final model tie-in:** In **Answer**, report the **entity types predicted by the final/best CTI-NER model**. In the **Long explanation**, include a **per-dataset table** and note differences across datasets.\n- **Provenance:** For each type (or set), state **Provenance = STIX 2.1 / Author-defined / Other standard (name)**. If mixed, annotate per type when stated.\n- **Canonicalization:** Preserve authors’ **exact names/casing**. If aliases/variants appear, choose a **canonical label** and list aliases in **notes**.\n- **No guessing sets:** Do **not** infer new types from background knowledge. You may add brief contextual clarifications about standards as **`[Background note] <≤25 words>`** (non-evidential), but **do not** use them to add or alter types.\n- **Nested/hierarchical:** If nesting is reported, represent **parent → child** relations in the **Long explanation**; otherwise output a flat list.\n- If authors explicitly state that the **final model** unifies types across datasets, add a **“Final model label set”** subsection with the unified list and a supporting quote.",
